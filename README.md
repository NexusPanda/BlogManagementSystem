## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### üîß Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Maven or Gradle
- PostgreSQL (running and accessible)

### üìÅ Configuration

This project requires a configuration file to run. The `application.properties` file is **intentionally ignored** in version control for security reasons.

#### ‚û§ Step 1: Create `application.properties`

Inside the folder:
```

src/main/resources/

```

Create a file named:

```

application.properties

````

#### ‚û§ Step 2: Add your configuration details

Here's a sample:

```properties
# Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/blog_db
spring.datasource.username=your_db_username
spring.datasource.password=your_db_password

# JPA Settings
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

# Server Port
server.port=8080
````

> You can also refer to the `application.properties.example` file included in the repo for reference.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

After setting up your `application.properties`, you can run the project using:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

or

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

## ‚úÖ Notes

* Do not commit your personal `application.properties` file to the repository.
* Use environment-specific files (`application-dev.properties`, etc.) for better separation.
